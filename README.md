# README file for Tidy Data Assignment

I created code that synthesized the UCI HAR Dataset into a single tibble data set giving the means of the measured values, according to subject number and activity label. The files in this github repository is the final dataset giving the synthesized tidy data (tidy_data),  my R code (run_analysis.R), and my code book that provides all the variables in the R code and tidy data set (code_book). 

In the R code, I first downloaded and unzipped the files. Then I saved the needed files in R data frames. Next I changed "Y_test" file and "Y_train" file from numbers to labels, using the "activity_labels" file to know how to convert numbers to labels. This gave vectors of the activity types. Next, I got mean and standard deviations (stdev) from the X_test and X_train files. I used "features.txt" to figure out which columns were the correct mean and stdev values. Because "GravityAcc" and "BodyGyro" are the only measured values, these are the only mean and stdev values that I selected. Next, I added columns for the subject number (subject_train) and activity type. Next, I named all of the columns. Next, I joined the test and train data sets. Next I used dplyr to group the joined data by subject number and activity and provide means of the mean and standard deviations of the measured values (means of the columns except for subject number and activity). This gave me a tibble. I wrote this data to a text file.
